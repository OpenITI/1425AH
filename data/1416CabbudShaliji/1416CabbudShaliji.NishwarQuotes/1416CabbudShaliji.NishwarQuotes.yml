90#BOOK#COMMENT##: These volumes are volumes 4-7 of al-Shalji's 8-volume edition
    of al-Tanūkhī's Nishwār. We have separated them from the other volumes of the edition,
    as they consist entirely of quotations of anecdotes from al-Tanūkhī in other works,
    and are not based on extant manuscripts of the Nishwār.
    "According to Yāqūt’s Irshād, Tanūkhī’s Nishwār al-Muḥạ̄dara was made up of 11 volumes, 
    each of which starts with an introduction. Moreover, among the manuscripts available to the editor 
    ʿAbbūd al-Shāljī is a British Museum library copy whose colophon specifies that it constitutes part 8 
    [of the Nishwār] and mentions a part 9 to come, which lends credibility to Yāqūt’s count. 
    As well as this British museum copy for part 8, al-Shāljī also had MS copies which he identified 
    as parts 1 and 2, and another MS copy which included an unknown part. 
    This unknown part he published in his edition as vol. 3. 
    (I should specify that with a complete MS of any part of the Nishwār, 
    it is fairly easy to identify what constitute a whole “part” since Tanūkhī 
    indeed prefaces each of his volumes with a introduction, and tells us so in his very first introduction, 
    that to part 1.). So to sum up, Shāljī had four volumes that very likely come from Tanūkhī,
    which he published as vol. 1, 2, 3 and 8. But because of the mention of 11 volumes in Yāqūt 
    and the existence of a part 8 according to the MS, without any trace of the missing parts 
    between [3] and 8 or beyond 8, Shāljī took it upon himself to hunt for the missing stories. 
    So he combed through books by Ibn al-Jawzī, al-Khaṭīb al-Baghdādī, al-Ṣābiʾ, Yāqūt, Ibn Khallikān, 
    and others known to quote Tanūkhī often, and looked for stories attributed to al-Muḥassin al-Tanūkhī 
    (under many possible versions of his name) or to his son (!) that were absent from al-Faraj baʿd al-shidda
    or the known Nishwār. He took comfort, as maybe we should, in the fact that in quite a few cases, 
    such stories are indeed found in the known Nishwār. But then he inserts all the others into his 
    edition of the Nishwār, to make up volumes 4, 5, 6, and 7 (...) he signposts them clearly. 
    But [volumes 4 to 7] of the Nishwār as they presently exist in the edition (...) 
    have no MS precedent and are a reconstruction by the editor." (Zina Maleh, personal communication)
