90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original text file contained the main text and Khumaynī's
    taʿlīqa.
    PV split the main text off from the taʿlīqa and marked
    Khumaynī's quotations as second-level headings.
    Perhaps it would be useful to add the first-level headings from the original
    text?
    PV also removed the remaining page headers that had become included in the text.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
    Link to the text file as it was before it was cleaned:
