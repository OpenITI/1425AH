90#VERS#COMMENT##: OCRed through Kraken۔ Page 110, 112, 146, 180 onwards
    missing.
    Missing pages, except 110,112, which could not be successfully OCR'd,
    replaced with updated OCR. As this is a modern texts all material was left
    in place,
    inc. footnotes. Generally the OCR was very good, although still required
    some fixes
    and re-building of interpolated lines.
    Qāʿida's are referred to in a number of ways,
    but there are significant numbers in separate, numbered sections.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
