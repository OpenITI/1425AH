90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The original text file contained two texts:
    * 0450Najashi.Rijal (main text)
    * 1424MuhammadCaliAbtahi.TahdhibMaqal (sharh, in the footnotes)
    PV split the texts into separate files and removed the endnotes.
    HRH: Numbers 198-9 are lost in both
    the PDF and the digital version. It must be a problem in the printed
    version.
    The original text file broke off suddenly after page PageV05P551.
    PV OCR'ed the remaining two pages of the commentary
    from the 1440/2018 edition.
    PV: The section headers should probably be copied over from
    Najāshī's text into the commentary.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
    removed by HRH and MGR (OpenITI Clean operation, 2023)
