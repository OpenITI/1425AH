90#VERS#COMMENT##: The text did not have automatic tags. All the tags are inserted manually. 2- The author name in the METADATA is wrong. It must be “MuhammadCaliAbtahi”. 3- The PARATEXT at the end of the text is written by the author himself. I’m not sure if this is considered PARATEXT or not.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
