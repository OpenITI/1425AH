90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: HRH
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The editor of this text has collected the lost pieces of 30 texts. At the beginning of each text there is an introductory part by the author which is about the lost piece and its author. I tagged these introductory parts as editorial, and showed the beginning of the main text by third-level blank headers with an asterisk (i.e. ### ||| *). After deleting the editorial sections, these headers must be removed. 2- The first part of the book is for historical sources and the second part is for literary sources (“شذرات من كتب مفقودة في الأدب”). The first part does not have any title. A title like “شذرات من كتب مفقودة في التاریخ” must be added in front of my first-level blank header in page 9. 3- The third part of the book is a “ملحقات” part which contains the newly-found pieces that must be added to the texts number 2, 5, 9, 12, 24.
    All paratextual elements
    (introductions, footnotes, indices, ...)
